# bioinfo-algo
This repo contains implementations of all assignments from a Bioinformatics Algorithms course taught by Professor Pavel Pevzner. The course was taught using the textbook [*Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach*](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/) and the problems were assigned through [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/).

The course covered a broad spectrum of topics including genome rearrangements, k-mer matching, motif finding, genome assembly, suffix trees, and the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
